- Search and Filter: Events created by any user can be filtered by any category.
- Geolocation: PlusOne will tell you how far away from any given event.
- Chat: Once you've subscribed to an event, you can engage in conversations with other participants of said event.
- Dual Database: PlusOne let's you swap where you get your events from, without having to restart the app.

## Use cases

- Bob wants to go and see his favourite band U2, and none of his friends want to go with him, but he doesn't want to go alone. Bob can use PlusOne to advertise he wants to go to the U2 concert, and find lonely strangers with a similar music taste to accompany him. 
- Juan and his team have a match next Saturday, but Jesus the goal-keeper just smashed his wrist. What to do? Pop an advert on PlusOne looking for bored goal-keepers looking for some fun on Saturday.
- Have a lunch break but hate your coworkers? You know what to do.
